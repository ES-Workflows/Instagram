From early starts to late shifts, our crews are out there getting it done, across worksites, warehouses, and everywhere in between.

At Extrastaff, we don’t just talk about workforce solutions, we live them. Real people, real skills, real results.
Wherever you are in NZ, chances are… we’ve got boots on the ground.

And because we know the mahi doesn’t stop, neither does the appreciation, that’s why the Extrastaff team loves showing up with a solid brekkie or a BBQ lunch to say thanks. Because hard work deserves more than just a handshake.

The Extrastaff team had the pleasure of putting on an early brekkie shout for the legends at @sansom_nz right at their yard and offices.

These guys show up day in, day out, with a serious work ethic, so we thought it was only right to show up with bacon, eggs, OJ, and a big thank you.

We’re proud to support teams like Sansom, where the mahi speaks for itself.
